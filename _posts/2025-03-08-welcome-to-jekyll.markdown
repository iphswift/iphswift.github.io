What is the desired end destination of Industrialism? Maybe it's not uploading our consciousness to simulations, or travelling on starships to arrive at distant planet. That's not to say that these things might not one day be feasible, I'm mostly concerned about when do we stop building factories. I think the inevitable answer is that we stop building factories when the factories start building themselves.

We've seen a new wave of technology in the last few years which brings a lot into question. Artificial intelligence, not speaking of general intelligence, is capable of performing increasingly complex tasks with less and less guidance. I do specifically point to it not being general intelligence again to highlight that significant scientific breakthroughs might not predate the transition to the next era. Instead, I am merely focused on autonomous agents: those capable of performing a task, and engaging in some amount of analysis and planning. Additionally, I would expect a further degree of physical automation. As much as possible, this future takes human beings out of the production process, and leaves machines to figure out production on their own.

So if machines are running the economy, what does that leave humans to do? To some, that seems like a question riddled with existential dread and loss of purpose. I don't think such catastrophization is necessary though. What if we all just collectively go back outside? If automation supplies us with a sufficient amount of food and medicine, and perhaps is actively engaged in computation to handle new challenges that appear, there's no reason for us not to just exist in the world. 

I don't think I have the information to accurately say what that society would look like. For example, how do social structures change when there is no longer a need for work? What types of activities do humans engage in when they are provided for and not tasked with the responsibility of providing? Imagine you waking up and knowing you have no responsibility. What does your day look like? How do you interact with people? The title of this post is "Let's Be Animals Again" because I equate our new role to that of an animal. Look to the roles of the animals that stay around your home, and think about how you could exist in the world if what was needed of you was relatively similar.

And as time, the robots could evolve. They could learn new sciences and technologies, explore space, maybe even construct simulations, or create an Artificial General Intelligence. How will humanity respond to this evolving techology? How will our new position in the world place us to interact with these discoveries? How does our identity change with regards to the machine over time? Will the machines eventually take us with them to see distant worlds? Maybe the best thing we can do here is to de-center the human experience. The experience we want, and our ambitions may need to be divorced for some time. We exist in a workless society, and also forfeit control over the technological progression of Earth. Yes, let's be animals again.
